### Features

Integrate zwave-js-ui natively in Domoticz_ynh.

**Zwave-JS-UI**, also known under previous name ZWaveJS2MQTT, is a replacement for Openzwave. It exposes Z-Wave devices to an MQTT broker in a fully configurable manner.

To work correctly, this app require to install either
- [domoticz package](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/domoticz_ynh) with **mqtt broker Mosquitto**
- or [Home-Assistant package](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/homeassistant_ynh)

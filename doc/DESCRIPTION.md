**!! WORK IN PROGRESS !! - DO NOT INSTALL YET**

### Features

Integrate zwave-js-ui natively in Domoticz_ynh.

**Zwave-JS-UI**, also known under previous name ZWaveJS2MQTT, is a replacement for Openzwave. It exposes Z-Wave devices to an MQTT broker in a fully configurable manner.

To work correctly, this app require **domoticz** with **mqtt broker Mosquitto** installed. Please refer to [domoticz package for Yunohost](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/domoticz_ynh) for more information about how to set up domoticz and Mosquitto.

This app may also be usable with [Home-Assistant package](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/homeassistant_ynh) but I never tested it.
